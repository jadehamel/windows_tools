# Windows Tools

This repository is a collection of tools that Iâ€™m building to address various issues encountered with the Windows operating system. Each tool is designed to simplify troubleshooting and maintenance tasks, making it easier to keep your system running smoothly.

## Tools Included

### 1. WinFixIt

**WinFixIt** is a Windows utility designed to resolve folder integrity issues in your system. This tool helps clean up and fix problems in Windows directories that may cause errors or unexpected behavior.

#### Features

- **Automated Folder Integrity Fix**: Scans and automatically fixes common issues related to Windows folder integrity.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and easy to use with a single click.
- **Safe and Secure**: Operates safely without making unauthorized changes to your system.

### 2. WSL Removal Script

This script completely removes the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) from a Windows machine. It unregisters all installed WSL distributions, disables the necessary Windows features, and deletes any leftover WSL-related files.

#### Features

- **Complete Removal**: Unregisters all WSL distributions and disables WSL-related features.
- **Clean-Up**: Deletes residual files associated with WSL, ensuring a thorough removal.
- **No Reboot Required**: Typically does not require a system reboot, though it's recommended.

### 3. Run Tools Script

The `run_tools.bat` script allows you to execute both the `WinFixIt` and `WSL Removal Script` in sequence. This is a convenient way to run both tools with a single command.

#### Usage

1. **Run as Administrator**: To ensure both tools execute properly, run `run_tools.bat` with administrative privileges.
2. **Process**:
   - The script first runs the WSL Removal Script to remove the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
   - Then, it runs the WinFixIt script to resolve any folder integrity issues on your system.

3. **Completion**: Once the script has finished executing, you will see a message confirming that all scripts have been executed.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running these scripts:

1. **Run as Administrator**: Ensure you are running the scripts with administrative privileges.
2. **Check Windows Version**: Verify that you are using a supported version of Windows (Windows 10 or later).
3. **Stop Running WSL Distributions**: For the WSL Removal Script, make sure there are no WSL distributions currently running. You can stop them using `wsl --shutdown` before running the script.
